 * Testcase Example:  '"ab"\n["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]'
 *
 * You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an
 * array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the
 * string appear in the string allowed.
 *
 * Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain
 * characters 'a' and 'b'.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: All strings are consistent.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= words.length <= 10^4
 * 1 <= allowed.length <=^ 26
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
 * The characters in allowed are distinct.
 * words[i] and allowed contain only lowercase English letters.
